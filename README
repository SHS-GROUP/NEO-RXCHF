==============================================================


In-house NEO code with current support for:
 - NEO Hartree-Fock (RHF and UHF)
 - NEO XCHF (RHF and UHF)
 - NEO RXCHF (one special electron)
    - RXCHF-ne (RHF and UHF)
    - RXCHF-ae (UHF)
    - RXCHF-fe (UHF)
 - NEO RXCHF (any number of special electrons)
    - RXCHF-ne (RHF)
    - RXCHF-ae (RHF for full closed shells of electrons)


---------------------
 Installation Notes:
---------------------

To compile a specific file in the cwd:
 - switch to directory containing *.f and execute ./comp [fname]
 - move resulting object file to object/ before linking

To compile all files necessary for NEO-XCHF:
 - switch to source/ and execute ./compall
 - automatically moves all object files to object/

To link all object files generated by compall into an executable runXCHF.exe:
 - switch to source/ and execute ./lked runXCHF


-----------------------
 Running Calculations:
-----------------------

Input file:  [jobname].inp where [jobname] is passed as first argument to executable
Input file format is in namelists: check example folders for format
Format for basis functions is:
   <primitive index> <contract index> <ang mom-x,y,z> <exponent> <contract coeff> <basis center x,y,z>
MO eigenvectors are output to FinalC*E.dat and FinalCP.dat
For RXCHF calculations with one special electron, its spin is assumed to be alpha
For restricted basis set calculations, &ALTBAS namelist must be included even if all basis functions are used


----------------------
 Version Information: 
----------------------

v1.1: Open-shell RXCHF-fe functionality added
v1.2: RXCHF-ne (closed/open shell) and RXCHF-ae (open shell) functionality added
v1.3: Microiterating for RXCHF methods, last stable release before multiple special electrons

v2.0: Multiple special electrons (RXCHF-ne, closed shell)
v2.1: RXCHF-ae added for fully closed shells (well-balanced for only 2 special electrons)

v3.0: Restricted basis set (RXCHF-ne, closed-shell, intersection method)
