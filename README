==============================================================


In-house NEO code with current support for:
 - NEO Hartree-Fock (RHF and UHF)
 - NEO XCHF (RHF and UHF)
 - NEO RXCHF (one special electron)
    - RXCHF-ne (RHF and UHF)
    - RXCHF-ae (UHF)
    - RXCHF-fe (UHF)
 - NEO RXCHF (any number of special electrons)
    - RXCHF-ne (RHF)


---------------------
 Installation Notes:
---------------------

To compile a specific file in the cwd:
 - switch to directory containing *.f and execute ./comp [fname]
 - move resulting object file to object/ before linking

To compile all files necessary for NEO-XCHF:
 - switch to source/ and execute ./compall
 - automatically moves all object files to object/

To link all object files generated by compall into an executable runXCHF.exe:
 - switch to source/ and execute ./lked runXCHF


-----------------------
 Running Calculations:
-----------------------

Input file:  basis_definition.inp (must have this name)
Check example folders for format
Format for basis functions is:
   <primitive index> <contract index> <ang mom-x,y,z> <exponent> <contract coeff> <basis center x,y,z>
MO eigenvectors are output to FinalC*E.dat and FinalCP.dat
For RXCHF calculations with one special electron, its spin is assumed to be alpha


----------------------
