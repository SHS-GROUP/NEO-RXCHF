Fully antisymmetric RXCHF ansatz support (RXCHF-exch)
Support for NEO-HF, NEO-UHF, XCHF, XCUHF, RXCHF-exch
No support for 'regular' RXCHF

To compile a specific file in the cwd:
 - switch to directory containing *.f and execute ./comp [fname]
 - move resulting object file to object/ before linking

To compile all files necessary for NEO-XCHF:
 - switch to source/ and execute ./compall
 - automatically moves all object files to object/

To link all object files generated by compall into an executable runXCHF.exe:
 - switch to source/ and execute ./lked runXCHF

Running NEO-XCHF:
 - Input file:  basis_definition.inp (must have this name)
 - Check example folders for format (includes NEO-RXCHF logical now)
 - Format for basis functions is:
   <primitive index> <contract index> <ang mom-x,y,z> <exponent> <contract coeff> <basis center x,y,z>
 - MO eigenvectors are output to FinalCE.dat and FinalCP.dat
