TEST01
======

System:      e+Hydride (2 electrons + 1 positron)
Level:       NEO-RXCHF/6s/8s
Compare to:  Corresponding NEO-UHF calculation

RXCHF:  FINAL NEOXCHF ENERGY IS       -0.6666367359 AFTER 128 ITERATIONS
XCUHF:  FINAL NEOXCHF ENERGY IS       -0.6666367346 AFTER  16 ITERATIONS


======
TEST02
======

System:      He (2 electrons) separated by 20 Ang from e+H (1 electron + 1 positron)
Level:       NEO-RXCHF/6s/16s starting from NEO-UHF orbitals
Compare to:  Corresponding NEO-UHF calculation

RXCHF:  FINAL NEOXCHF ENERGY IS       -0.6666367359 AFTER 128 ITERATIONS
XCUHF:  FINAL NEOXCHF ENERGY IS       -0.6666367346 AFTER  16 ITERATIONS

(Starting from core guess leads to loc min: 2e- on H and 1e- on He)
