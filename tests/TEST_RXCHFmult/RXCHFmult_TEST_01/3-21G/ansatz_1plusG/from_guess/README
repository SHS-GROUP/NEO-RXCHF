Start from converged orbitals:
 - guessCAE.inp : Converged GAMESS He run
 - guessCBE.inp : Converged XCHF PsH run
 - guessCP.inp  : Converged XCHF PsH run

Regular electrons (He) answer:
 E = E_He + E_nuc + E_core^p + E_ep + E_ec

     E_He     : He energy
     E_nuc    : Classical repulsion between He and H nuclei
     E_core^p : Positron core energy
     E_ep     : Interaction between reg elecs and positron (-E_nuc in large d)
     E_ec     : Interaction between reg elecs and H nucleus (-E_nuc in large d)

 => E = E_He + E_core^p - E_nuc

 E_He     = -2.8356798736 (from GAMESS)
 E_nuc    =  0.0052917725
 E_core^p =  0.3627467029

 =>     E = -2.4782249432 (matches RXCHF calculation)


Special electrons (PsH) answer:
 E = E_PsH + E_nuc + E_ec + E_pc

     E_PsH    : PsH energy
     E_nuc    : Classical repulsion between He and H nuclei
     E_ec     : Interaction between sp elecs and He nucleus (-2E_nuc in large d)
     E_pc     : Interaction between positron and He nucleus (E_nuc in large d)

 => E = E_PsH

 E_PsH    = -0.7351388067 (from XCHF)

 =>     E = -0.7351388067 (matches RXCHF calculation)
