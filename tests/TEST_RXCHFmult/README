System:      He (2 electrons) separated by 200 Ang from PsH (2 electron + 1 positron)
Level:       NEO-RXCHF with PsH parameters (6s/6s basis set, NGTG=2) from 2012 JCP, and 3-21G/6-311G for helium
Compare to:  Corresponding RHF calculation for He and XCHF calculation for PsH(ngtg=2 data from 2012 JCP)
Notes:       Need to start from converged orbitals or else RXCHF does not converge
              - nonconvergence apparent in XCHF calculation of PsH in the presence of the He charge

3-21G

He (GAMESS) :      FINAL RHF ENERGY IS       -2.8356798736 AFTER   2 ITERATIONS

TEST02
======

System:      He (2 electrons) separated by 200 Ang from LiPs (4 electron + 1 positron)
Level:       NEO-RXCHF with LiPs parameters (8s/6s basis set, NGTG=8) from 2012 JCP, and 3-21G for helium
Compare to:  Corresponding RHF calculation for He and XCHF calculation for LiPs(data from 2012 JCP)
Notes:       Converges to a solution that splits the special electrons
              - happens even when localized orbitals are given as starting guess
              - * NEED TO TEST 4-PARTICLE INTERACTION INTEGRALS *

System:      LiPs (4 electrons) with nontrivial geminals
Level:       NEO-RXCHF (just G-ansatz XCHF part) / pc0/5s
Compare to:  Corresponding NEO-XCHF calculation
Notes:       Orbitals not exactly identical: perhaps due to convergence criteria/microiterating

RXCHF :  FINAL NEORXCHF ENERGY IS       -7.9467704905 AFTER   6 ITERATIONS
