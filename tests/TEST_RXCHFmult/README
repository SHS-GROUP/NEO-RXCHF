System:      He (2 electrons) separated by 200 Ang from PsH (2 electron + 1 positron)
Level:       NEO-RXCHF with PsH parameters (6s/6s basis set, NGTG=2) from 2012 JCP, and 3-21G/6-311G for helium
Compare to:  Corresponding RHF calculation for He and XCHF calculation for PsH(ngtg=2 data from 2012 JCP)
Notes:       Need to start from converged orbitals or else RXCHF does not converge
              - nonconvergence apparent in XCHF calculation of PsH in the presence of the He charge

3-21G

He (GAMESS) :      FINAL RHF ENERGY IS       -2.8356798736 AFTER   2 ITERATIONS
PsH (XCHF)  :  FINAL NEOXCHF ENERGY IS       -0.7351388067 AFTER   9 ITERATIONS
Total       :                                -3.5708186803

TEST02
======

System:      He (2 electrons) separated by 200 Ang from LiPs (4 electron + 1 positron)
Level:       NEO-RXCHF with LiPs parameters (8s/6s basis set, NGTG=8) from 2012 JCP, and 3-21G for helium
Compare to:  Corresponding RHF calculation for He and XCHF calculation for LiPs(data from 2012 JCP)
Notes:       Converges to a solution that splits the special electrons
              - happens even when localized orbitals are given as starting guess
              - unclear how to test this at this point
