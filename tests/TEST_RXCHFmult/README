System:      He (2 electrons) separated by 50 Ang from PsH (2 electron + 1 positron)
Level:       NEO-RXCHF with PsH parameters (6s/6s basis set, NGTG=2) from 2012 JCP, and STO-2G for helium
Compare to:  Corresponding RHF calculation for He(STO-2G) and XCHF calculation for PsH(ngtg=2 data from 2012 JCP)
