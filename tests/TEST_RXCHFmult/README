System:      He (2 electrons) separated by 200 Ang from LiPs (4 electron + 1 positron)
Level:       NEO-RXCHF with LiPs parameters (8s/6s basis set, NGTG=8) from 2012 JCP, and 3-21G for helium
Compare to:  Corresponding RHF calculation for He and XCHF calculation for LiPs(data from 2012 JCP)      (*)
             Corresponding RHF calculation for He and RXCHF calculation for LiPs(two special electrons) (**)
Notes:       When localized orbitals are given as a starting guess
              - converges to the He(RHF) + LiPs(XCHF) solution (*)
             When normal guess is used
              - converges to the He(RHF) + LiPs(RXCHF-2e) solution (**)
             RXCHF-ae is not tested since in its current formalism, the correct limits are not obtained when N_s > 2
             When normal guess is used with restricted basis set
              - converges to the He(RHF) + LiPs(RXCHF-2e) solution (**)
