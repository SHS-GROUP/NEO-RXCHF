System:      He (2 electrons) separated by 50 Ang from PsH (2 electron + 1 positron)
Level:       NEO-RXCHF with PsH parameters (6s/6s basis set, NGTG=2) from 2012 JCP, and 3-21G or 6-311G for helium
Compare to:  Corresponding RHF calculation for He and XCHF calculation for PsH(ngtg=2 data from 2012 JCP)

Results:     Test passes when G ansatz is used. See README file in each ansatz_G/ directory for each basis set
             Test fails when 1+G ansatz is used.
