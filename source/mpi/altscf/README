Alternative SCF implementations:
  freezereg           : Microiterating with regular orbitals frozen
  nomicro             : No microiterating
  nomicro-freezereg   : No microiterating with regular orbitals frozen
  protmicro           : Microiterate proton prior to microiterations for electrons
  protmicro-freezereg : Microiterate proton prior to microiterations for electrons with regular orbitals frozen
Select which to use by modifying the SCF routine call in ../rxchf_driver_MPI.f
